## Title
A domain-aware, topology-biased glycan language model for viral receptor binding

## One-Sentence Thesis
Viral glycan binding is a strong domain for a glycan language model because it is biologically important and supported by tractable datasets.

## Core Outline
1. Motivation and significance
   - Why viral glycan binding is a good domain for a glycan LM
   - Why microarray datasets make this tractable
2. Related work and the gap
   - What already exists
   - What is still missing

## Quick Start
```bash
python main.py
```
